# Tune

The `/tune` command opens a modal UI for adjusting runtime model behaviour. It lets you change tool profiles, compaction strategy, native tool calling, and model parameters without restarting Nanocoder.

Applying a change in `/tune` clears the current chat history, because the tool profile changes which tools and prompt the model sees. Save anything you need first.

Settings are persisted to `nanocoder-preferences.json` and restored on next launch.

## Opening Tune

Type `/tune` in the chat input. Use arrow keys to navigate, **Enter** to select, and **Esc** to cancel.

## Settings

### Enabled / Disabled

The top menu item toggles tune on or off. Tune is **on** by default, with the `auto` tool profile. When disabled, the full tool set, native tool calling and default model parameters are used. When enabled, the full settings menu appears.

### Tool Profile

Controls which tools the AI has access to.

| Profile | Tools | Behaviour |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **auto** (default) | Resolves to `full`, `minimal`, or `nano` from the active model id | Cloud/unknown models get `full`; models up to 15B parameters get a reduced profile automatically |
| **full** | All registered tools including MCP servers | No filtering applied |
| **minimal** | 8 core tools: `read_file`, `write_file`, `string_replace`, `execute_bash`, `find_files`, `search_file_contents`, `list_directory`, `agent` | Slim prompt and single-tool enforcement enabled automatically |
| **nano** | 5 core tools: `read_file`, `diff_edit`, `write_file`, `execute_bash`, `search_file_contents` | Ultra-slim prompt, single-tool enforcement, AGENTS.md omitted by default |

The **auto** profile is the default. It keeps the full tool surface for cloud models and model ids with no size hint, resolves models up to 15B parameters to `minimal`, and resolves models up to 4B parameters to `nano`. The status bar shows the resolved profile, for example `tune: minimal (auto)`.

> **What about tasks and walkthroughs?** `write_tasks` and `write_walkthrough` are part of the `full` profile only. Under `minimal` or `nano` the AI will not build a task list or record a completion walkthrough — that prompt and tool budget is spent on editing instead. `/tasks` still works for managing the list yourself. Plan mode is the exception: `write_plan` is added back on every profile so plan review works everywhere. See [Task Management](task-management.md) and [Development Modes](development-modes.md).

> **Why don't I see my MCP tools?** MCP tools are only exposed in the resolved `full` profile. If you connect an MCP server but the model cannot see its tools, open `/tune` and either switch the tool profile to **full** or use a larger/cloud model so `auto` resolves to `full`. `/mcp` still shows connected servers even when the current tool profile filters their tools out of the model prompt.

The **minimal** profile is designed for small models (1B-15B parameters) that struggle with large tool sets. It reduces the system prompt size and forces the model to call one tool at a time.

The **nano** profile is designed for the smallest models or low-end hardware running larger models locally. It is strictly more aggressive than `minimal`:

- Drops `find_files`, `list_directory`, and `agent` (subagent delegation).
- Drops the `CORE PRINCIPLES` and `CODING PRACTICES` prompt sections.
- Uses shortened `TASK APPROACH`, `FILE OPERATIONS`, `CONSTRAINTS` sections (≤4 lines each).
- Replaces the verbose `SYSTEM INFORMATION` block with a single-line `## SYSTEM` line.
- Omits `AGENTS.md` from the system prompt by default (override with the **Include AGENTS.md** toggle).

Together these reduce the system prompt from ~500–700 tokens (`minimal`) to roughly ~150–250 tokens (`nano`), leaving more of the context window for actual work.

### Include AGENTS.md

Toggles whether `AGENTS.md` from the project root is appended to the system prompt.

- Defaults **ON** for `full` and `minimal` profiles (preserves prior behaviour).
- Defaults **OFF** for the `nano` profile, including when `auto` resolves to `nano` for the active model.
- Can be flipped explicitly per session, persisted via preferences, or pinned in `agents.config.json` via `tune.includeAgentsMd`.

Disabling this is useful on tiny models that get crowded out by long project guidelines.

### Aggressive Compact

When enabled, sets the auto-compact threshold to 50% (the lowest supported threshold) and mode to `aggressive`. This compresses conversation history earlier and harder, which helps models with small context windows.

It applies whenever the active tune has it on, including tune restored from preferences or config at startup. A threshold or mode you set yourself with `/compact --threshold` or the `/compact` flags for the session takes priority, and toggling tune does not clear it.

### Native Tool Calling

Cycles through three tool-calling modes:

- **ON** (`toolMode: "native"`, the default) - tools go through the provider's native tool calling API.
- **OFF (XML fallback)** (`toolMode: "xml"`) - tools are described in the system prompt and the model emits XML tool calls.
- **OFF (JSON fallback)** (`toolMode: "json"`) - tools are described in the system prompt and the model emits JSON tool calls.

The fallbacks can help with models that have unreliable native tool support.

### Model Parameters

Fine-tune the model's generation parameters:

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Temperature** | 0.1 - 2.0 | Controls randomness. Lower = more focused, higher = more creative |
| **Top P** | 0 - 1.0 | Nucleus sampling. Lower = fewer token choices considered |
| **Top K** | 1 - 200 | Limits token choices to top K candidates |
| **Max Tokens** | 64 - 32768 | Maximum response length |
| **Frequency Penalty** | -2.0 - 2.0 | Penalises repeated tokens. Higher = less repetition |
| **Presence Penalty** | -2.0 - 2.0 | Penalises tokens already used. Higher = more topic diversity |

Press **Enter** on a parameter to cycle through values. Select **Reset All to Defaults** to clear all parameter overrides.

### Provider-specific parameters

Some providers accept additional reasoning controls that are configured through `agents.config.json` rather than the `/tune` modal:

- **`reasoningEffort`** / **`reasoningSummary`** — reasoning controls for OpenAI Responses API models (GPT-5, o-series) via the `chatgpt-codex` provider. `reasoningEffort` is also forwarded to OpenRouter as `reasoning.effort`.

OpenRouter exposes additional always-on request body fields (provider routing, plugins, service tier, fallback models, etc) on the provider config itself — see [OpenRouter request options](../configuration/providers/openrouter.md#openrouter-request-options). Those settings are not tied to tune and apply on every request.

## Presets

Three built-in presets are available via **Load Preset**:

| Preset | Settings |
|--------|----------|
| **Default** | Resets everything to defaults (tune enabled, `auto` profile, no aggressive compact) |
| **Small Model** | Minimal tool profile, aggressive compact, temperature 0.7 |
| **Nano (low-end hardware)** | Nano profile, aggressive compact, AGENTS.md off, temperature 0.4, max tokens 2048 |

Selecting a preset populates the tune form — you can further adjust settings before applying.

## Configuration Layers

Tune settings resolve from these layers, lowest priority first (later layers win):

1. **Hardcoded defaults** - `enabled: true`, `toolProfile: 'auto'`, `aggressiveCompact: false`
2. **Per-provider config** - `tune` on a provider entry in `nanocoder.providers`
3. **Preferences** - saved by the `/tune` UI to `nanocoder-preferences.json`
4. **Top-level config** - `nanocoder.tune` in `agents.config.json`
5. **Session** - changes made with `/tune` in the current session

Because top-level config sits above preferences, a `nanocoder.tune` block in `agents.config.json` wins over whatever `/tune` saved last time once you restart. Use `/tune` for per-session experiments, or remove `nanocoder.tune` if you want the saved preferences to stick.

### Example: Per-Provider Config

Set defaults for a specific provider in `agents.config.json`:

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "providers": [
      {
        "name": "Ollama",
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
        "models": ["qwen2.5-coder:7b"],
        "tune": {
          "enabled": true,
          "toolProfile": "minimal",
          "aggressiveCompact": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This applies the minimal profile and aggressive compact while the Ollama provider is active, unless your preferences or a top-level `nanocoder.tune` block set those fields.

## Interaction with Development Modes

Tune works alongside [development modes](development-modes.md):

- **Plan mode + minimal profile** - the model gets `read_file`, `find_files`, `search_file_contents`, `list_directory` and `agent` for exploration, plus `write_plan`
- **Plan mode + nano profile** - the model gets `read_file` and `search_file_contents` for exploration, plus `write_plan`, with the shortened plan-mode prompt
- **Plan mode + full profile** - all plan-mode tools are available, including read-only git, diagnostics, web, and interaction tools
- Mode exclusions are filtered on top of the tune profile

## Status Bar

When tune is enabled, the status bar shows the resolved tool profile. When the profile is `auto`, wide terminals also mark it:

```
tune: minimal (auto)
```

On narrow terminals the `(auto)` marker is dropped.
