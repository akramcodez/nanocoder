# Skills

A **skill** is the unit of extension in Nanocoder — the umbrella that
unifies [commands](./custom-commands.md), [subagents](./subagents.md),
and [tools](./custom-tools.md), plus the event subscriptions that fire
them. If you're adding any kind of custom behaviour to Nanocoder, this
is the page to start with; the individual command / subagent / tool
pages drill into the per-member details.

Skills come in two ergonomic forms - a single `.md` file in
`.nanocoder/commands|agents|tools/` (the **single-file** form) or a
directory under `.nanocoder/skills/` containing a `skill.yaml` and any
subset of `commands/`, `agents/`, `tools/` subdirs (the **bundle** form).

Both forms produce the same runtime data model, register into the same
registries, and surface through the same `/skills` slash command.

## Why two forms

Most extensions are a single piece: a command, a subagent, or a tool.
For those, the single-file form keeps the cost at exactly one file -
exactly how `.nanocoder/commands/`, `.nanocoder/agents/`, and
`.nanocoder/tools/` already work today.

A bundle skill is for multi-piece features. A "PR reviewer" skill wants
its subagent (the reviewer), a tool (`gh_pr_diff`), and a command
(`/review`) to ship and version together. The bundle form gives that a
home with one manifest and one shareable artifact.

## Single-file form

Drop one `.md` into the right flat dir. Frontmatter declares the
member; the file basename is the skill name (a namespaced command such
as `commands/refactor/dry.md` is the skill `refactor:dry`). A command,
an agent and a tool may share a name - they show up as separate
entries in `/skills`.

```markdown
<!-- .nanocoder/agents/docs-agent.md -->
---
name: docs-agent
description: Watch docs and refresh outputs when source changes.
subscribe:
  - kind: file.changed
    paths: ["docs/**"]
    eventKinds: [add, change]
---

You watch the docs directory for changes...
```

The `subscribe:` block is new. When the per-project daemon is running,
it wakes this subagent whenever a file under `docs/**` changes.

## Bundle form

A directory under `.nanocoder/skills/<name>/` with `skill.yaml`:

```
.nanocoder/skills/k8s/
  skill.yaml
  commands/k8s.md
  agents/k8s-agent.md
  tools/
    k8s_pods.md
    k8s_logs.md
```

```yaml
# skill.yaml
name: k8s                        # required, kebab-case: ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$
description: Kubernetes operational helpers.   # required
version: 0.2.0                   # optional
author: you@example.com          # optional
tags: [kubernetes, ops]          # optional, informational (not used for matching)

subscribe:
  - kind: file.changed
    target: agent:k8s-agent
    paths: ["k8s/**/*.yaml"]

tools_visibility:
  default: scoped
```

`tools_visibility: scoped` (or `global`) is shorthand for the
`default:` mapping above.

Inside a bundle, members are aware of each other:

- A bundle's subagent automatically gets its sibling tools in its
  effective tool list, even when its frontmatter has a `tools:`
  allowlist. You do not list `k8s_pods` and `k8s_logs` in
  `agents/k8s-agent.md`'s `tools:` field - they are siblings.
- Scoped tools (`tools_visibility.default: scoped`, the default for
  bundles) are hidden from the global tool list - only the bundle's
  own subagent sees them.
- Set `tools_visibility.default: global` to expose tools alongside
  built-ins, MCP tools, and the existing `.nanocoder/tools/*.md`
  flat-form tools.

### How many of each member kind?

- `commands/` — **any number**. Each file auto-namespaces under the
  bundle name, so `commands/status.md` in bundle `k8s` invokes as
  `/k8s:status`. Shortcut: `commands/<bundleName>.md` (e.g.
  `commands/k8s.md`) keeps the bare bundle name (`/k8s`).
- `agents/` — **exactly one (or zero)**. The agent is the bundle's
  brain; if you need a second one, that's a second skill. Extra `.md`
  files in `agents/` are ignored and reported as a load error.
- `tools/` — **any number**. Tools are named by their frontmatter
  `name:` (snake_case), independent of the bundle name.

A multi-verb bundle is natural:

```
.nanocoder/skills/git/
  skill.yaml                # name: git
  commands/
    status.md               # invokes as /git:status
    commit.md               # invokes as /git:commit
    push.md                 # invokes as /git:push
  agents/git-agent.md       # one shared agent
  tools/
    git_log.md
    git_diff.md
```

## Event subscriptions

Subscriptions can declare on member frontmatter (target is implicit
`self`) or on the bundle manifest (target is explicit `kind:name`):

```yaml
# bundle manifest, multiple targets in one place
subscribe:
  - kind: file.changed
    target: agent:docs-agent
    paths: ["docs/**"]

  - kind: schedule.cron
    target: command:weekly-report
    cron: "0 9 * * MON"
```

Inside a bundle, member frontmatter must not set `target:` itself - a
member's subscription always targets that member. Put explicit targets
in `skill.yaml`.

Target kinds:

- `agent:` - the daemon runs the subagent with a prompt describing the
  event and its payload.
- `command:` - the daemon renders the command (with no arguments, so
  parameter defaults apply) and runs it as an unattended agent run,
  with the event payload appended. In a bundle manifest, name the
  member as it appears in `commands/` (`command:status`, not
  `command:k8s:status`).
- `tool:` - rejected. A triggered tool call has nothing to fill in its
  arguments, so the subscription reports an error at load time. Point
  the subscription at an agent or command that calls the tool instead.
- `skill:` - parsed for forward compatibility, but registering it
  today raises a clear "not supported yet" error.

Event kinds:

- `file.changed` - filters: `paths` (glob list; omit it to match every
  file) and `eventKinds` (any of `add`, `change`, `unlink`; omit it to
  match all three). Globs support `*`, `**`, `?` and `{a,b}`; negation
  (`!`) is not supported. Changes under `.git/`, `node_modules/` and
  `.nanocoder/` are never reported.
- `schedule.cron` - filter: `cron`, a standard 5-field expression (or
  6-field with seconds). An invalid expression is rejected when the
  file loads instead of reaching the daemon.

A malformed `subscribe:` block on a single-file command, agent or tool
is logged and dropped: the member still loads, just without triggers.
In `skill.yaml` it fails the bundle's load, with the error shown by
`/skills` and in the daemon log.

### `confirm: true`

Default: triggered runs execute in `headless` mode (autonomous, no
foreground prompts). Set `confirm: true` on a subscription to make the
run execute in `plan` mode instead - the subagent proposes changes
without applying them.

```yaml
subscribe:
  - kind: file.changed
    target: agent:docs-agent
    paths: ["docs/**"]
    confirm: true
```

## The daemon

Events only fire while a process is running to host them. The
interactive TUI does NOT start file watchers or cron tickers — that's
the daemon's job.

```
nanocoder daemon start      # spawn the per-project daemon detached
nanocoder daemon stop       # SIGTERM the daemon, wait for lockfile cleanup
nanocoder daemon status     # report running / not running, PID, uptime
nanocoder daemon logs       # tail .nanocoder/daemon.log (last 64KB)
nanocoder daemon install    # install per-user auto-start
nanocoder daemon uninstall  # remove the auto-start unit
```

`daemon start` refuses to start in a directory you haven't trusted, because triggered runs execute tools without confirmation. Trust the directory by running `nanocoder` interactively there once, pass `--trust-directory` to bypass the check for that one start (not saved), or set `NANOCODER_TRUST_DIRECTORY=1` to trust it and save that for future runs.

The daemon writes a JSON lockfile at `.nanocoder/daemon.json` (PID,
socket path, start time) and an append-only log at
`.nanocoder/daemon.log`. Stale lockfiles (PID no longer alive) are
reaped automatically on the next `daemon start` or `daemon status`.

Auto-start ships for **macOS** (LaunchAgent under
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`), **Linux** (systemd user unit under
`~/.config/systemd/user/`), and **Windows** (Task Scheduler task
registered via `schtasks /Create /XML` with an ONLOGON trigger; the XML
manifest is stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nanocoder\tasks\`). All three
are namespaced by a short hash of the project path so multiple projects
each get their own daemon.

The daemon's IPC surface uses an `AF_UNIX` socket at
`.nanocoder/daemon.sock` on macOS/Linux and a named pipe at
`\\.\pipe\nanocoder-daemon-<hash>` on Windows. Unix socket paths are
capped by `sockaddr_un.sun_path` (104 bytes on macOS, 108 on Linux), and
libuv silently truncates anything longer, so for deeply nested projects
the socket moves to `<tmpdir>/nanocoder-daemon-<hash>.sock` instead. The
bound path is recorded in the lockfile, so clients always read it back
rather than recomputing it. `nanocoder daemon stop`
prefers an IPC shutdown request (clean drain of the event loop) and
falls back to `SIGTERM` only if the daemon is unreachable, so stops are
graceful on Windows too where `SIGTERM` would otherwise be force-kill.

Internally, the daemon runs every triggered agent or command in
**`headless`** mode (no foreground prompts, no `ask_user`, no `agent`,
and only tools that never need approval). The
`confirm: true` opt-in below switches a specific subscription to plan
mode instead.

Triggered runs are subagent runs, so the
[`maxRepeatedToolCalls`](../configuration/index.md#retry-limits) cap
applies: a triggered skill whose model gets stuck repeating the same
tool call stops with an error instead of burning tokens unattended (see
[Loop Protection](./subagents.md#loop-protection)).

## Inspecting and creating skills

```
/skills                 list every loaded skill
/skills show k8s        details for one skill (members, subscriptions, source)
/skills create k8s      scaffold a new bundle at .nanocoder/skills/k8s/
/skills check k8s       validate a bundle without loading it
/skills promote k8s     copy a project skill up to the global level
/skills demote k8s      copy a global skill down into this project
```

`/skills create` only scaffolds **bundles**. For single-file skills, use
the existing creators:

```
/commands create my-cmd     scaffold .nanocoder/commands/my-cmd.md
/agents create my-agent     scaffold .nanocoder/agents/my-agent.md
/tools create my-tool       scaffold .nanocoder/tools/my-tool.md
```

Each of those drops a stub file in the right flat dir and chains into an
AI-assisted design conversation so the model can help fill in the
frontmatter and body.

## Installing a skill from a repository

A bundle is one shareable artifact, so it can be installed straight from a
git repository:

```
nanocoder skills add owner/repo                        owner/repo shorthand
nanocoder skills add https://example.com/skills.git    any git URL
nanocoder skills add ./local-checkout                  a local directory, git repo or not
nanocoder skills add pr-reviewer                       resolve the name through the index
```

Flags:

```
--ref <ref>       branch, tag, or commit to clone
--subdir <path>   where the bundle sits inside the repo
--global          install into the config dir instead of this project
--force           replace an existing skill of the same name
--yes             skip the trust prompt (for scripts and CI)
--index <url>     use a different skills.json for name resolution
```

Without `--subdir`, the manifest is looked for at the repo root, then at
`skills/<name>/`, then across a one-directory-per-bundle layout. A repo with
several bundles and no `--subdir` lists the candidates rather than guessing.

### The trust prompt

Installing a skill means running its code: a bundle tool is a shell script,
`approval: never` skips confirmation entirely, and a `subscribe:` block makes
the daemon fire it unattended. Nothing is written into the project until you
have seen what that means, so the prompt names every tool with its approval
policy and every subscription with its trigger:

```
Skill "pr-reviewer" v0.1.0 by nano-collective
  Reviews pull requests and posts findings.

  from: https://github.com/Nano-Collective/nanocoder-skills
  into: /repo/.nanocoder/skills/pr-reviewer

  Commands: /pr-reviewer:review
  Agent:    reviewer
  Tools (visible only to this skill's agent):
    - gh_pr_diff · shell script · approval: never (runs WITHOUT asking) · read-only
  Event subscriptions (the daemon fires these unattended):
    - file.changed → agent:reviewer · paths src/**

Installing a skill means running its code. Only install skills you trust.
Install this skill? [y/N]
```

Before you ever see that prompt the bundle has been shallow-cloned into a
temp dir, had its `.git` stripped, been rejected if it contains a symlink (a
bundle is markdown and YAML; a symlink is only ever an escape attempt), and
been validated by the same linter `/skills check` runs. Declining leaves the
project untouched. Accepting lands the bundle through the same copy the
`promote` / `demote` commands use, so it refuses to overwrite an existing
skill unless you pass `--force`.

### The index

Bare names resolve through a plain `skills.json` file - a list, hosted in a
git repo, not a registry service:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "pr-reviewer",
      "description": "Reviews pull requests and posts findings.",
      "repo": "https://github.com/Nano-Collective/nanocoder-skills",
      "subdir": "skills/pr-reviewer"
    }
  ]
}
```

Point `NANOCODER_SKILLS_INDEX` (or `--index`) at another URL, or at a local
file, to use a different list - a team can check one into its own repo. If
the index promises one name and the cloned manifest declares another, the
install is refused.

The default index above isn't published yet, so a bare name won't resolve
until it is; install by `owner/repo`, a git URL, or a local path in the
meantime, or point `NANOCODER_SKILLS_INDEX` at your own list.

## Sharing skills across repos

Skills load from three levels, highest priority first:

- **project** - `.nanocoder/skills/` (and the flat `commands|agents|tools/`
  dirs) in the working directory. Scoped to this repo, committed with it.
- **personal / global** - the same layout under your platform config dir
  (`~/.config/nanocoder/` on Linux, `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/` on
  macOS, or `$NANOCODER_CONFIG_DIR`). Available in every repo on the machine.
- **built-in** - shipped with nanocoder. Today that is only the
  `explore` subagent; no built-in bundles ship yet.

A project skill shadows a personal one of the same name, which shadows a
built-in. To reuse a skill you wrote in one repo everywhere, move it up a
level; to vendor a global or built-in skill into a repo so teammates get it,
move it down:

```
/skills promote pr-review          copy project -> global, keep both
/skills promote pr-review --move    move project -> global, remove the original
/skills demote pr-review           copy global -> project, keep both
/skills demote pr-review --move     move global -> project, remove the original
```

Notes:

- Both default to **copy**, leaving the original in place. After a copy you
  have the skill at both levels and the higher-priority one wins on the next
  load. Pass `--move` to remove the source instead.
- The copy refuses to overwrite an existing skill at the destination. Re-run
  with `--force` to replace it.
- `promote` only works on a project skill; `demote` works on a global or
  built-in skill (demoting a built-in vendors a copy you can then edit).
- Both write to disk only. Restart nanocoder for the new copy to load.

## Migration from `schedules.json`

The legacy scheduler (the `ScheduleRunner` that read
`.nanocoder/schedules.json`) has been **removed**. Cron-driven runs now
happen exclusively through skill subscriptions executed by the daemon.

Move each entry into the targeted command's frontmatter, or into a bundle
manifest. When the cron fires, the daemon renders the command and runs it
as an unattended agent run in `headless` mode:

Before:
```json
[{"cron": "0 9 * * MON", "command": "/weekly-report"}]
```

After (frontmatter form):
```markdown
<!-- .nanocoder/commands/weekly-report.md -->
---
description: Monday morning summary.
subscribe:
  - kind: schedule.cron
    cron: "0 9 * * MON"
---

Summarize last week's commits...
```

After (manifest form, inside a bundle):
```yaml
subscribe:
  - kind: schedule.cron
    target: command:weekly-report
    cron: "0 9 * * MON"
```

If `.nanocoder/schedules.json` is present when Nanocoder boots, you see
a loud warning pointing at this migration guide. The file itself is no
longer read - only its presence triggers the warning.

After migrating, run `nanocoder daemon start` (or `nanocoder daemon
install` for auto-start across reboots) to make the cron subscriptions
actually fire.
