# Desktop Notifications

When Nanocoder is running a long task in the background, you might switch to another window and miss when it needs your input. Desktop notifications let you know when attention is required.

## Quick Start

Open `/settings` and select **Notifications** to enable them. Toggle which events you want to be notified about:

- **Tool Confirmation** — a tool call needs your approval
- **Question Prompt** — the AI has asked you a question
- **Generation Complete** — the AI has finished responding and is ready for your next message
- **Triggered Run Complete** — a daemon-triggered skill run has finished

You can also enable notification **sound**, and a **Terminal Bell** that writes a BEL character to stdout. The bell is rendered by the terminal emulator itself, so it still reaches you over SSH or inside tmux, where the desktop notifiers cannot land.

The bell rides along with the desktop notification, so it needs the master **Notifications** toggle on as well - Terminal Bell on its own does nothing. If you are inside tmux and hear nothing, tmux swallows the bell unless it is configured to pass it through:

```
set -g monitor-bell on
set -g bell-action any
```

## How It Works

Nanocoder uses native OS notification APIs — no bundled binaries or external dependencies.

| Platform | Method | Icon Support |
|----------|--------|:------------:|
| **macOS** | `terminal-notifier` (if installed) | Yes |
| **macOS** | `osascript` (fallback) | No |
| **Linux** | `notify-send` | Yes |
| **Windows** | PowerShell (system tray balloon notification) | No |

### macOS — Getting the Best Experience

By default, Nanocoder falls back to `osascript` which shows basic notifications without the Nanocoder icon. For the full experience with icon support and proper click-to-focus behaviour, install `terminal-notifier` via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Nanocoder will automatically detect and use it. You may need to allow notifications for `terminal-notifier` in **System Settings > Notifications** the first time.

### Linux

Notifications use `notify-send`, which is included with most desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.). The Nanocoder icon ships with the package and is included automatically.

## Configuration

Notification preferences are stored in `nanocoder-preferences.json` under the top-level `notifications` key. You can configure them via `/settings` or by editing the file directly:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sound": true,
    "bell": true,
    "events": {
      "toolConfirmation": true,
      "questionPrompt": true,
      "generationComplete": false
    },
    "customMessages": {
      "toolConfirmation": {
        "title": "Action Required",
        "message": "Nanocoder needs your approval"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master toggle for all notifications |
| `sound` | boolean | `false` | Play a sound with each notification (macOS only; Linux and Windows use the system's default notification behaviour) |
| `bell` | boolean | `false` | Also write a terminal bell (BEL) to stdout — skipped when stdout is not a TTY |
| `events.toolConfirmation` | boolean | `true` | Notify when a tool needs approval |
| `events.questionPrompt` | boolean | `true` | Notify when the AI asks a question |
| `events.generationComplete` | boolean | `true` | Notify when a response is ready |
| `events.triggeredRunComplete` | boolean | `true` | Notify when a daemon-triggered skill run finishes |
| `customMessages.<event>` | object | — | Override the default title and message for an event |

Events you leave out of `events` keep their default of `true`, so `{"notifications": {"enabled": true}}` is enough to turn every event on.

Notification titles include the current project directory name, e.g. "Tool Confirmation Required in my-project".
