/**
 * Discovery file for the VS Code WebSocket companion.
 *
 * The companion server (`nanocoder --vscode`) binds to an ephemeral loopback
 * port and mints a per-session random token, then writes the two values to a
 * well-known JSON file under the user's nanocoder config directory. The VS
 * Code extension reads the file to learn where (and how) to connect.
 *
 * Threat model
 * ------------
 * Anyone who can read the user's config directory can already act as that
 * user on the same machine, so writing the token to disk does not widen the
 * trust boundary: the only adversary it protects against is one who can
 * observe the loopback network traffic but cannot read the user's files.
 * The token therefore lives in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
 * during the WebSocket upgrade, never in the URL. Query strings are routinely
 * logged by HTTP intermediaries; loopback has none of those but using a
 * header keeps the rationale honest and the door closed if anything TLS-
 * terminating ever sits in front of the socket.
 *
 * Stale detection
 * ---------------
 * Each file records the PID of the CLI that wrote it. On read we ask the
 * kernel whether that PID is still alive; if not, the file is treated as
 * missing so a crashed CLI cannot hold the port hostage.
 *
 * This module is intentionally self-contained (no `@/...` aliases) so the VS
 * Code extension can bundle it via esbuild without having to teach the
 * bundler about the source tree's path aliases.
